=== AI MAFIA GAME LOG ===

NIGHT 1
Thomas was killed during the night.

DAY - DISCUSSION
Hanzo: It's still early, but I find Victor's sudden interest in everyone else's actions a bit suspicious. He seems to be trying too hard to divert attention away from himself. I think we should keep an eye on him while gathering more information.

Baltazar: I don't trust anyone yet, but I find it suspicious that Thomas was killed on the first night. It could be a random act, or maybe someone wanted to frame another player. For now, I'd vote None since I don't have enough evidence to point fingers just yet.

Jessica: It's hard to say right now, since we don't have much information. I think we should keep an eye on everyone, but I don't feel strongly suspicious of anyone just yet. None for now seems reasonable.

Clara: I really have no idea who to suspect right now since it’s just the first day and we don't have much information. I feel like we should focus on figuring out who might have wanted to hurt Thomas. Maybe we can discuss what everyone was doing last night?

Victor: Well, you know, I just met a guy named Thomas who had a fantastic sense of humor, but I guess he's off telling jokes in the afterlife now. Honestly, I’m not really suspicious of anyone yet; it's too early to tell. But if Clara starts cracking more jokes than me, I might have to keep an eye on her!

NIGHT 2
Jessica was killed during the night.

DAY - DISCUSSION
Hanzo: I find it interesting that Jessica was taken out last night. While I don't have concrete evidence, Clara's behavior has seemed a bit off to me; she might be trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm leaning towards voting for her unless someone presents a stronger case.

Baltazar: I'm still trying to piece everything together after Jessica's death. Clara seemed a bit too eager to point fingers yesterday, which makes me wonder about her intentions. I’m leaning towards voting for her, but it’s tough to feel confident with only the three of us left.

Clara: I feel really sad about Jessica's death; it’s so unfair. I don’t have strong suspicions about anyone yet, but I think we should pay close attention to what everyone says. For now, I might just vote "None" since I’m not sure who to trust.
